# Linked List Insertion

Insertion into a linked list has three cases:

-   Inserting a new node before the head (at the beginning).
    
-   Inserting a new node after the tail (at the end of the list).
    
-   Inserting a new node at the middle of the list (random location).
    

Let’s have a look at all the cases, one by one.

## Inserting a Node at the Beginning

In this case, a new node is inserted before the current head node. Only one next pointer need to be modified and it can be done in two steps:

### Approach:

-   Create a new node
    
-   Update the next pointer of the new node, to point to the current head.
    
-   Update head pointer to point to the new node.
    

Below is the implementation of the above algorithm.
```c++
// inserts a node at the beginning of the Linked List
// head- pointer to the head of the Linked List
// data - newNode's data value
struct ListNode * insertAtBeginning(struct ListNode * head, int data) {
   ListNode * newNode = new ListNode(); // create a node
   newNode -> data = data; // set newNode's data value
   newNode -> next = NULL; // set as NULL

   if (head == NULL) { // then list empty, so set as head node
      head = newNode;
   } else { // else add to left of list
      newNode -> next = head;
      head = newNode;
   }
   return head;
}
```

-   Space Complexity: O(1)

## Inserting a Node at the ending

In this case, we need to modify two next pointers (last node’s next pointer and new node’s next pointer). We traverse the list to find the last pointer and do this.

### Approach:

-   Create a new node
    
-   Traverse the list to find the last node in the linked list
    
-   Update next pointer of last node to point to the new node
    

Below is the implementation of the above algorithm.
```c++
// inserts at the end of Linked List
// head- pointer to head of Linked List
// data - newNode's data value
struct ListNode * insertAtEnd(struct ListNode * head, int data) {
   ListNode * newNode = new ListNode(); // create a node
   newNode -> data = data; // set newNode's data value
   newNode -> next = NULL; // set as NULL
   ListNode * current = head; // iterator for list
   if (current == NULL) { // set newNode as head
      head = newNode;
   } else {
      // find end of current list
      while (current -> next != NULL) {
         current = current -> next;
      }
      // current is now the last node in list (next==NULL)
      // set newNode as new next node
      current -> next = newNode;
   }
   return head;
}
```

## Inserting a Node at the Given Position

Let us assume that we are given a position where we want to insert the new node. The position is denoted by an integer. 1 means inserting at the head, 2 means inserting at head’s next and so on.

In this case also, we need to modify two next pointers.

### Approach:

-   Create a new node
    
-   Traverse the list to find the node(X) next to which we have to insert the new node
    
-   Update next pointer of X to point to the new node
    
-   Update the next pointer of the new node to point to the next pointer of X.
    

Below is the implementation of the above algorithm.
```c++
// 1 base indexing
// Inserts a new node (new) at position n and returns head.
// head- pointer to the head of the Linked List
// data - data value of newNode
// n - position for insertion n>=1
struct ListNode * insertAtPosition(struct ListNode * head, int data, int n) {
   ListNode * newNode = new ListNode(); // create a node
   newNode -> data = data; // set data value
   newNode -> next = NULL; // set as end of list
   // pred will point to predecessor of newNode
   ListNode * pred = head;
   //Special case: adding at head
   if (n == 1) {
      newNode -> next = head;
      return newNode;
   }
   // find the n-1 node (predecessor): decrement and move forward in the list
   // until either the list has ended or n becomes 0
   while (--n && pred != NULL) {
      pred = pred -> next; // repoint pred to next element
   }
   if (pred == NULL)
      return NULL;
   // if it is not NULL, insert new after its predecessor
   newNode -> next = pred -> next;
   pred -> next = newNode;
   return head;
}
```
