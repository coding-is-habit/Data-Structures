### Linked list has the following properties
* Each node of linked list is made up of two items- the data and reference to the next node. 
* Successive elements are connected by pointers.
* The entry point into linked list is called head of the list.(head os not a seperate node, but the reference to the first node)
* If the list is empty then the head is NULL.
* The last elements points to NULL.
* Can grow and shrink in size during execution of a program.
* Can be made just as long as required (until system memory exahusts).
* Does not waste memory space (but takes some extra memory for pointers). It allocates memory as list grows.
