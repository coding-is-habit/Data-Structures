# Traversing a Linked List

Let us assume that the head points to the first node of the list. To traverse the list we do the following:

### Approach:

-   Keep track of the current pointer using a variable current
   --   Check if current is not NULL 
-   If not NULL, then print the data of the node. Update current to current->next.
    
-   If NULL, then stop
    

Below is the implementation of the above algorithm.
```c++

// prints all the nodes of the Linked List

// head- pointer to head of the Linked List

void print(struct ListNode* head) {

struct ListNode *current = head;

while(current != NULL) {

cout<<current->data<<" "; // print the node's data

current = current -> next; // advancing the pointers

}

return;

}
```
-   Time Complexity: O(n), for iterating the list of size n
    
-   Space Complexity: O(1), for creating a temporary variable
