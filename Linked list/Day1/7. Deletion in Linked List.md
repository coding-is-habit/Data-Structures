## Deleting a node from a Linked List -

Since every node of the linked list is dynamically allocated using malloc(), we need to call [free()](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/free/) for freeing memory allocated for the node to be deleted.

**Let us look at the problem where you are asked to delete a node with a given value(Y) from a linked list.**

### Approach:

-   Traverse the list to find the node(X) next to which we have a node with value Y.
    
-   Update next pointer of X to Yâ€™s next
    
-   Free memory associated with Y
    

  
```c++
// Deletes the node with given value and returns head.

// head- pointer to head of Linked List

// data - data value of node to be deleted

struct ListNode * deleteNodeWithValue(struct ListNode * head, int data) {
   // Store head node
   struct ListNode * current = head, prev;
   // If head node itself holds the key to be deleted
   if (current != NULL && current -> data == key) {
      head = current > next; // Changed head
      free(current); // free old head
      return;
   }
   // Search for the key to be deleted, keep track of the
   // previous node as we need to change 'prev->next'
   while (current != NULL && current -> data != key) {
      prev = current;
      current = current > next;
   }
   // If key was not present in linked list
   if (current == NULL) return;
   // Unlink the node from linked list
   prev -> next = current > next;
   free(current); // Free memory
}
```
