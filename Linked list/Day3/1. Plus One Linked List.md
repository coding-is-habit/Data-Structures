## Plus One Linked List
Given a non-negative integer represented as a linked list of digits,  _plus one to the integer_.
 
The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the  `head`  of the list.
 
**Example 1:**
 
**Input:** head = 1->2->3
 
**Output:** 1->2->4
 
 
**Example 2:** 
 
**Input:** head = 0
 
**Output:** 1
### Intuition:
 
* Idea is to just reverse the linked list so we can access the nodes we need to increase sequentially.  
E.g. `1->2->3` --> `3->2->1` 
* Then just iteratively add a value and deal with carries if they arise by tracking with a variable.  
* If we reach the end of our list and still have a carry (like in the case of `9->9->9`, then we just add a new node at the end.  
* We have to reverse everything back at the end so it's back in proper left to right order.
 
```c++
ListNode * removeElements(ListNode * head, int val) {
 
  ListNode * curr = head;
  if (head == NULL) {
    return NULL;
  }
  while (curr -> next != NULL) //Iterate until linked list is not null
  {
    // If the next element's value equals val. Then Shift currents next to the next of current's next node. And repeat same, checking current with currents next.
    if (curr -> next -> val == val) {
      curr -> next = curr -> next -> next;
    } else // otherwise shift current to currents next.
    {
      curr = curr -> next;
    }
  }
  if (head -> val == val) // Check if the initial Head ( beginning current) was equal to Val. If so, shift it to next.
  {
    head = head -> next;
  }
  return head;
}
```
 
**Time Complexity:** O(n), reverse the list and then again reverse it in O(n). 
 
**Space Complexity:** O(1) space though so, in theory, could be better than a recursive solution, which would require O(n) space for the callstack.
