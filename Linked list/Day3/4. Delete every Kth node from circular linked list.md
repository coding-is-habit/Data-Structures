## Delete every Kth node from circular linked list
Delete every kth Node from a circular linked list until only one node is left. Also print the intermediate lists.
**Examples:**

**Input :** n=4, k=2, list = 1->2->3->4

**Output:**

1->2->3->4->1

1->2->4->1

2->4->2

2->2

**Input :** n=9, k=4, list = 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9

**Output :**

1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9->1

1->2->3->4->6->7->8->9->1

1->2->3->4->6->7->8->1

1->2->3->6->7->8->1

2->3->6->7->8->2

2->3->6->8->2

2->3->8->2

2->3->2

2->2

**Algorithm**  
Repeat the following steps until there is only one node left in the list.  
**Case 1**: List is empty.  
If the list is empty, simply return.

**Case 2**: List has only one node.  
If the list has only one node left, we will print the list and return as our goal is reached.

**Case 3**: List has more than one nodes.  
Define two pointers curr and prev and initialize the pointer curr with the head node.  
Traverse the list using curr pointer by iterating it k times.

-   Node to be deleted is the first node of the list.  
    Condition to check this`( current == head && current->next == head)`.  
    If yes, then move prev until it reaches the last node. After prev reaches the last node, set `head = head -> next` and `previous -> next = head`. Delete current.
-   Node to be deleted is the last node in the list.  
    Condition to check this is `current -> next == head`.  
    If current is the last node. Set `prev -> next = head` and delete the node curr by `delete current`.
-   Node to be deleted is neither the first node nor the last node, then set `previous -> next = current -> next` and `delete current`.

**Implementation**
```c++
/*Function to delete every kth Node*/
void deleteK(ListNode ** head, int k) {

  // If list is empty, simply return. 
  if (head == NULL)
    return;

  // take two pointers - current and previous 
  ListNode * current = head, * prev;
  while (true) {

    // Check if Node is the only Node
    // If yes, we reached the goal, therefore return.

    if (current -> next == head && current == head)
      break;

    // If more than one Node present in the list, 
    // Make previous pointer point to current
    //Iterate current pointer k times, 
    // i.e. current Node is to be deleted. 
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
      previous = current;
      current = current -> next;
    }

    // If Node to be deleted is head 
    if (current == head) {
      previous -> next = current -> next;
      head = previous -> next;
    }

    // If Node to be deleted is last Node. 
    else if (current -> next == head) {
      previous -> next = head;
    } else {
      previous -> next = current -> next;
    }
    delete current;
    current = previous;
  }
}
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n*k)

**Space Complexity:**  O(1)
