## Delete every Kth node from circular linked list
Delete every kth Node from a circular linked list until only one node is left. Also print the intermediate lists.
**Examples:**

**Input :** n=4, k=2, list = 1->2->3->4

**Output:**

1->2->3->4->1

1->2->4->1

2->4->2

2->2

**Input :** n=9, k=4, list = 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9

**Output :**

1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9->1

1->2->3->4->6->7->8->9->1

1->2->3->4->6->7->8->1

1->2->3->6->7->8->1

2->3->6->7->8->2

2->3->6->8->2

2->3->8->2

2->3->2

2->2

**Algorithm**  
Repeat the following steps until there is only one node left in the list.  
**Case 1**: List is empty.  
If the list is empty, simply return.

**Case 2**: List has only one node.  
If the list has only one node left, we will print the list and return as our goal is reached.

**Case 3**: List has more than one nodes.  
Define two pointers curr and prev and initialize the pointer curr with the head node.  
Traverse the list using curr pointer by iterating it k times.

-   Node to be deleted is the first node of the list.  
    Condition to check this( curr == head && curr->next == head).  
    If yes, then move prev until it reaches the last node. After prev reaches the last node, set head = head -> next and prev -> next = head. Delete curr.
-   Node to be deleted is the last node in the list.  
    Condition to check this is (curr -> next == head).  
    If curr is the last node. Set prev -> next = head and delete the node curr by free(curr).
-   Node to be deleted is neither the first node nor the last node, then set prev -> next = temp -> next and delete curr.

**Implementation**
```c++
/*Function to delete every kth Node*/
void deleteK(Node ** head_ref, int k) {
  Node * head = * head_ref;

  // If list is empty, simply return. 
  if (head == NULL)
    return;

  // take two pointers - current and previous 
  Node * current = head, * prev;
  while (true) {

    // Check if Node is the only Node\ 
    // If yes, we reached the goal, therefore  
    // return. 
    if (current -> next == head && current == head)
      break;

    // Print intermediate list. 
    printList(head);

    // If more than one Node present in the list, 
    // Make previous pointer point to current 
    // Iterate current pointer k times, 
    // i.e. current Node is to be deleted. 
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
      previous = current;
      current = current -> next;
    }

    // If Node to be deleted is head 
    if (current == head) {
      previous = head;
      while (previous -> next != head)
        previous = previous -> next;
      head = current -> next;
      previous -> next = head;
      * head_ref = head;
      free(current);
    }

    // If Node to be deleted is last Node. 
    else if (current -> next == head) {
      previous -> next = head;
      free(current);
    } else {
      previous -> next = current -> next;
      free(current);
    }
  }
}
/*Utility function to print the circular linked list*/
void printList(Node * head) {
  if (head == NULL)
    return;
  Node * temp = head;
  do {
    cout << temp -> data << "->";
    temp = temp -> next;
  } while (temp != head);
  cout << head -> data << endl;
}
```
```
Output:
1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9->1
1->2->3->4->6->7->8->9->1
1->2->3->4->6->7->8->1
1->2->3->6->7->8->1
2->3->6->7->8->2
2->3->6->8->2
2->3->8->2
2->3->2
2->2
