### Rotate the sub-list of a linked list from position M to N to the right by K places
 
Given a linked list and two positions ‘m’ and ‘n’. The task is to rotate the sublist from position m to n, to the right by k places.
 
**Examples:**
 
**Input:**  list = 1->2->3->4->5->6, m = 2, n = 5, k = 2  
**Output:**  1->4->5->2->3->6  
* Rotate the sublist 2 3 4 5 towards right 2 times  
* then the modified list are: 1 4 5 2 3 6
 
**Input:**  list = 20->45->32->34->22->28, m = 3, n = 6, k = 3  
**Output:**  20->45->34->22->28->32  
* Rotate the sublist 32 34 22 28 towards right 3 times  
* then the modified list are: 20 45 34 22 28 32
 
**Approach:**  For rotating the given sublist that extends from m to n element,
*  move the list from (n-k+1)<sup>th</sup>  to n<sup>th</sup>  node to starting of sub-list to finish the rotation.
* If k is greater than the size of sublist then we will take its modulo with size of the sublist. So traverse through list using a pointer and a counter and we will save (m-1)<sup>th</sup> node and later make it point to (n-k+1)<sup>th</sup>  node and hence bring (n-k+1)<sup>th</sup> node to the start(front) of sublist.  
* Similarly we will save m<sup>th</sup> node and later make nt<sup>th</sup> node point to it. And for keeping rest of list intact we will make (n-k)<sup>th</sup> node point to next node of n (maybe NULL). And finally we will get the k times right rotated sublist.
```c++
void rotateSubList(ListNode * head, int m, int n, int k) {
  int size = n - m + 1;
 
  // If k is greater than size of sublist then we will take its modulo with size of sublist 
  if (k > size) {
    k = k % size;
  }
 
  // If k is zero or k is equal to size or k is a multiple of size of sublist then list remains unchanged 
  if (k == 0 || k == size) 
    return;

 
  ListNode * link = NULL; // for m-th node 
  if (m == 1) {
    link = head;
  }
 
  // This loop will traverse all node till end node of the sublist.     
  ListNode * current = head; // current to traverse list 
  int count = 0; // Count number of nodes traversed 
  ListNode * end = NULL;
  ListNode * previous = NULL; // Previous of m-th node 
  while (current != NULL) {
    count++;
 
    // We will save (m-1)th node and later make it point to (n-k+1)th node 
    if (count == m - 1) {
      previous = current;
      link = current -> next;
    }
    if (count == n - k) {
      if (m == 1) {
        end = current;
        head = current -> next;
      } else {
        end = current;
 
        // That is how we bring (n-k+1)th node to the front of the sublist. 
        previous -> next = current -> next;
      }
    }
 
    // This keeps rest part of list intact. 
    if (count == n) {
      ListNode * link2 = current -> next;
      current -> next = link;
      end -> next = link2;
      return;
    }
    // advance to next nodes
    current = current -> next;
  }
}
```
 
**Output:**
```
Given List: 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 
After rotation of sublist: 10 20 50 60 30 40 70
```
 
**Time Complexity:** O(n)
 
**Space Complexity:**  O(1)
