### Rotate the sub-list of a linked list from position M to N to the right by K places

Given a linked list and two positions ‘m’ and ‘n’. The task is to rotate the sublist from position m to n, to the right by k places.

**Examples:**

**Input:**  list = 1->2->3->4->5->6, m = 2, n = 5, k = 2  
**Output:**  1->4->5->2->3->6  
* Rotate the sublist 2 3 4 5 towards right 2 times  
* then the modified list are: 1 4 5 2 3 6
 
**Input:**  list = 20->45->32->34->22->28, m = 3, n = 6, k = 3  
**Output:**  20->45->34->22->28->32  
* Rotate the sublist 32 34 22 28 towards right 3 times  
* then the modified list are: 20 45 34 22 28 32

**Approach:**  For rotating the given sublist that extends from m to n element,
*  move the list from (n-k+1)<sup>th</sup>  to n<sup>th</sup>  node to starting of sub-list to finish the rotation.
* If k is greater than size of sublist then we will take its modulo with size of sublist. So traverse through list using a pointer and a counter and we will save (m-1)<sup>th</sup> node and later make it point to (n-k+1)<sup>th</sup>  node and hence bring (n-k+1)<sup>th</sup> node to the start(front) of sublist.  
* Similarly we will save m<sup>th</sup> node and later make nt<sup>th</sup> node point to it. And for keeping rest of list intact we will make (n-k)<sup>th</sup> node point to next node of n (maybe NULL). And finally we will get the k times right rotated sublist.
```c++
// This function take head pointer of list, start and 
// end points of sublist that is to be rotated and the 
// number k and rotate the sublist to right by k places. 
void rotateSubList(ListNode * head_ref, int m, int n, int k) {
  int size = n - m + 1;

  // If k is greater than size of sublist then we will take its modulo with size of sublist 
  if (k > size) {
    k = k % size;
  }

  // If k is zero or k is equal to size or k is a multiple of size of sublist then list remains intact 
  if (k == 0 || k == size) {
    ListNode * head = head_ref;
    while (head != NULL) {
      head = head -> next;
    }
    return;
  }

  ListNode * link = NULL; // m-th node 
  if (m == 1) {
    link = head_ref;
  }

  // This loop will traverse all node till end node of sublist.     
  ListNode * current = A; // Current traversed node 
  int count = 0; // Count of traversed nodes 
  ListNode * end = NULL;
  ListNode * previous = NULL; // Previous of m-th node 
  while (c != NULL) {
    count++;

    // We will save (m-1)th node and later make it point to (n-k+1)th node 
    if (count == m - 1) {
      previous = current;
      link = current -> next;
    }
    if (count == n - k) {
      if (m == 1) {
        end = current;
        head_ref = current -> next;
      } else {
        end = current;

        // That is how we bring (n-k+1)th node to front of sublist. 
        previous -> next = current -> next;
      }
    }

    // This keeps rest part of list intact. 
    if (count == n) {
      ListNode * link2 = c -> next;
      current -> next = link;
      end -> next = link2;
      ListNode * head = head_ref;
      while (head != NULL) {
        cout << head -> data << " ";
        head = head -> next;
      }
      return;
    }
    current = current -> next;
  }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Given List: 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 
After rotation of sublist: 10 20 50 60 30 40 70
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n)

**Space Complexity:**  O(1)
